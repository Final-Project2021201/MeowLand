Inspect your golden ears, eyes and oral health and hygiene every week. While shedding is unavoidable, frequent grooming (daily to weekly) lessens the amount of hair shed by the animal.

They are sociable and love company, preferring to be wherever their owners are. Maine Coons are energetic cats and require lots of room to exercise in. If you keep a Maine Coon as an indoor cat you should provide it with plenty of space to move around in and give it plenty of toys for entertainment. It is essential to groom a Maine Coon at least weekly. To ensure your cat will allow you to groom it, itâ€™s advisable to groom it gently from a kitten. Regular grooming will minimize shedding, prevent your cat from swallowing fur and suffering from fur balls and also stop large mats from forming.');
