<h5>Guide to German Shepherd Dogs</h5>

<h6>Diet</h6>
<p>German Shepherds can have a healthy appetite and can go through dog food quickly, so using meat to feed your Shepherd (as well as for training purposes) can go a long way in keeping the dog well-fed. Mixing in vegetables such as green beans is a great idea. Some people recommend constructing “pies” or “casseroles” of assorted ingredients using meats and vegetables together.When it comes to dry dog food, keep in mind that a healthy adult German Shepherd can go through some 40 pounds of it in a month.</p>

<h6>Training</h6>
<p>One of the reasons Shepherds are so popular with pet owners is being highly obedient. In addition, German Shepherds are considered one of the most intelligent breeds of dogs. Some people find that German Shepherds will adapt to a new behavior after only a few repetitions. You’ll even find that a German Shepherd’s obedience and protective nature will make it an ideal guard dog. As such, it is important to reinforce boundaries with your Shepherd. Your dog should know the difference between welcome and unwelcome visitors; don’t assume that because your German Shepherd is strong that it can’t be controlled with a little calm and rational training. However, it is important to emphasize positive rewards for good behavior rather than punishment; negative reinforcement is often closer to abuse than training. Training and socialization should begin as early as possible, so don’t let those early and impressionable puppy days go to waste. And remember, always be as safe as possible around an animal the size of a Shepherd.</p>
<h6>Common Health Problems</h6>
<p>German Shepherds can frequently suffer from joint problems, including arthritis. Since they are large dogs, German Shepherds are prone to frequent bloating. One disease to watch out for is the internal bleeding disease known as Von Willebrand disease, an inherited disorder that has a higher rate among German Shepherds. Since this disease can be hereditary, it’s a good idea to check your German Shepherd’s pedigree. It’s important to maintain regularly scheduled checkups with a veterinarian (especially as your pooch ages into its senior years) to ensure that any potential health issues are identified and treated as quickly as possible.</p>

<h6>Exercise</h6>
<p>German Shepherds make good exercise companions, especially if you have a large backyard that you can keep to yourself and your family. Exercise is also a great way to help children bond with a dog like the German Shepherd, which is known for its loyalty once it makes these bonds. It’s important that German Shepherds end up with owners who are able to keep up with their rather intensive exercise demands. If these d don’t burn off enough energy through exercise every day, they will find other far less pleasant ways of burning off their excess energy. keep these exercise demands in mind before committing to these beautiful breed.</p>

<h6>Life Expectancy</h6>
<p>A lifespan of about 13 to 15 years is normal for dogs the size of German Shepherds.</p>

<h5>Guide to Golden Retrievers</h5>

<h6>Diet</h6>
<p>Meals for Golden Retrievers should consist of a proper balance of protein, carbohydrates, fatty acids, vitamins and minerals. If you are going with a premium line of dog food, stay away from those with rich ingredients – Golden Retrievers don’t handle this kind of food well. If your Golden Retriever has digestive issues, try a lamb and rice dog food. And when choosing a dog food, lean toward those that come with a high-quality source of protein with no fillers or artificial preservatives.</p>

<h6>Temperament</h6>
<p>Very loyal and sociable, the Golden Retriever loves interacting with humans and having fun. They make great pets for families with children and are not prone to attacking visitors (except with kisses!). They are also great with other animals too, even with those which are smaller than them, unlike other hunting breeds. They are calm and well-mannered and can also make good watchdogs.</p>

<h6>Training</h6>
<p>The Golden Retriever is a pleasure to train. This breed is easily trained and loves to learn new tricks. Golden Retrievers want to please its owner, so they will work hard at being obedient and loyal. Because Golden Retrievers are so active, you’ll want to use the training sessions to expend some of this energy.</p>
<h6>Common Health Problems</h6>
<p>Golden Retrievers are susceptible to a variety of ailments, so any signs of illness or changes in behavior should be taken seriously. Some of the most common conditions affecting Golden Retrievers include cataracts, elbow dysplasia, epilepsy, hip dysplasia, heart disease and skin allergies.</p>

<h6>Exercise</h6>
<p>You’ll find that since Golden Retrievers are an athletic breed, they will need plenty of exercise in order to be healthy and content. Take your dog out for long walks, play games and let your Golden Retriever run free in open spaces and socialize with other dogs. If you like to spend time outdoors, you’ll be happy to learn that Golden Retrievers make great hiking or camping buddies.</p>

<h6>Life Expectancy</h6>
<p>Golden Retrievers have a life expectancy of 10 to 13 years.</p>

<h5>Guide to Pomeranians</h5>

<h6>Diet</h6>
<p>Pomeranians are known to be picky eaters, and since this breed needs to be fed dry dog food in order to prevent tooth loss, feeding them can be a problem. Try to stay away from table scraps – your Pomeranian will develop a taste for it and may ignore its dry food altogether.</p>

<h6>Training</h6>
<p>Pomeranians can be a handful at times – although they are intelligent, they can also be willful. Start training as soon as possible and be consistent. Since the breed is smart, your dog can be taught some amazing tricks. Like most dogs, crate training your Pomeranian is important, as it needs a den of its own.</p>

<h6>Temperament</h6>
<p>Because of its small size, which makes it more prone to injury, the Pomeranian is best suited for homes with older children. In addition, smaller children may get your Pomeranian overly excited. Households with older children are ideal, as Pomeranians will be more likely to be showered with the attention they desire. It’s also a good idea to get your kids involved with training – it’s a wonderful way to set boundaries and build strong bonds. The Pomeranian suffers from small dog syndrome, which means it doesn’t know it’s a small dog. That’s why it will pick a fight with a much bigger dog. And because the Pomeranian loves attention, ensure that it’s not left alone for long periods of time. As long as your Pomeranian gets the exercise it needs and lots of love, it will make an excellent pet.</p>

<h6>Common Health Problems</h6>
<p>You should be aware of a few health conditions that are fairly common with Pomeranians. One of the most frequent is early tooth loss. You can help prevent this by feeding your Pomeranian a healthy diet of dry dog food that helps condition its teeth and gums. You can also brush your Pomeranian’s teeth daily.  Always check with the breeder in order to identify any potential problems in the parental lines of a Pomeranian and make sure your dog gets regular check-ups so issues can be identified early on.</p>

<h6>Life Expectancy</h6>
<p>Pomeranians have a life expectancy of 12 to 16 years.</p>

<h6>Exercise</h6>
<p>The Pomeranian needs regular exercise though it is possible for them to get a fair amount by simply running around the house. We recommend taking them for a daily walk – besides, the Pomeranian will love the attention it gets along the way.</p>

<h5>Guide to Poodles</h5>

<h6>Diet</h6>
<p>Poodles thrive on a diet based on high-quality dry food for dogs. Always rely on a veterinarian's expertise before making any changes to your pup’s nutrition.</p>

<h6>Training</h6>
<p>When it comes to exceptionally smart dogs, this breed ranks at the very top of the list. The impressive smarts are not reserved for only one type of Poodle either. All of them are considered to be second only to Border Collie in terms of intelligence. If you have the right training approach, this dog is going to be highly trainable. They won’t have a problem learning commands or even elaborate tricks and routines- as long as they have the proper motivation. It’s important to focus on positive reinforcement and rewards based training. Anything less is closer to abuse and will never get the results you desire. It will only harm the dog and your relationship.</p>

<h6>Temperament</h6>
<p>The Poodle’s temperament is often about energy. From the Standard to the Miniature, you can expect your dog to be playful and lively- contrary to the popular image of a perfectly groomed lazy lap dog. They are also very sweet and affectionate. Combine that with their human-like intelligence and you have a dog that forms an inseparable bond to his family. Your Poodle will feel more like a fury relative than a family pet. Curious, goofy, and smart, Poodle will love to play and can be a great companion to children. However, Toy and Miniature variants are also very fragile so they shouldn’t be left alone with young children, as they could inadvertently hurt them. These are fragile animals who need to be handled with a gentle touch at all times. </p>

<h6>Common Health Problems</h6>
<p>Poodles can run into a few nasty health problems including Addison’s Disease, thyroid issues, and cancer. Like almost all dogs, this breed can run into problems with the joints such as hip dysplasia. It’s important to maintain regularly scheduled checkups with a vet to ensure that any potential health issues are identified and treated as early as possible.</p>

<h6>Exercise</h6>
<p>Being energetic as they are, this breed will need a good deal of exercise. A lot of them will also enjoy living up to their hunting and pointing instincts. As former retrievers, Poodles should be able to enjoy chasing balls and Frisbees, as well. They will require at least 30 to 60 minutes daily exercise, depending on their size and overall activity level. If you are unable to meet these exercise requirements, your Poodle will run the risk of developing obesity or burning off all of their excess energy doing mischievous activities that your might not appreciate.</p>

<h6>Life Expectancy</h6>
<p>A standard Poodle should have a life expectancy of around 12-15 years. The same approximate life expectancy goes for Miniature Poodles, which gives them plenty of time to grow up along with your children if you’re considering getting this breed as a family pet.</p>

<h5>Guide to Samoyeds</h5>

<h6>Diet</h6>
<p>Samoyeds do well on a raw diet, which is no surprise, as its ancestors were used for hunting. Even if you go the dry dog food route, feel free to throw your dog some extra meat and even a real bone to chew on. As well, your Samoyed may enjoy raw fruits and vegetables.</p>

<h6>Training</h6>
<p> You’ll need more than skill to train this intelligent and independent dog. Don’t get us wrong – of course it is possible, but it will take a lot of time, patience and consistency in order to be successful. You do have something going in your favor – the Samoyeds are eager to please. It will take a firm hand to train them and this breed does need consequences of its actions, so use positive reinforcement and praise as part of the training process. It’s important to make it fun and energetic for your dog, since it can be somewhat resistant to obedience training. You must always make sure you keep the upper hand at all times during the training process. That way, your position as alpha is understood and unchallenged. Since it is a pack dog, the Samoyed will be happiest once it knows its position in the pack. Start training your Samoyed early and your life with this dog will run a lot smoother. It’s also a great way to stop bad habits such as barking, chewing, jumping up, nipping, and grabbing onto objects.</p>

<h6>Temperament</h6>
<p>An excellent companion dog, the Samoyed loves being around people. This breed is great with children and needs lots of attention and affection. The Samoyed will not do well if it is left alone for long periods of time. The breed suffers from separation anxiety and is known to act out as a result of being away from its family (this includes destructive chewing and incessant barking). So if you work full time outside of the home, this is not the breed for you. Since this is a herding dog, you’ll have to watch for instincts such as nipping at your children’s heels. Your Samoyed will also chase cats, deer, and livestock if given the opportunity to do so. It’s a natural instinct to them and a very difficult to break. Even though it is an intelligent dog, the Samoyed can be difficult to train. You should use consistent training methods and make sure the whole family is onboard in order to provide a unified front. As well as using treats for good behavior, make sure that there are consequences for bad behavior.</p>

<h6>Common Health Problems</h6>
<p>The most common health problems known to affect the Samoyeds include hip dysplasia, cataracts, glaucoma, and diabetes. Hip dysplasia affects the hips and can range in severity from moderate to severe pain. If left untreated, cataracts may lead to blindness, as will glaucoma, and diabetes is often known to reduce the lifespan of the Samoyed.</p>

<h6>Life Expectancy</h6>
<p>Samoyeds have a life expectancy of 12 to 15 years.</p>

<h6>Exercise</h6>
<p>dog by nature and ancestry, the Samoyed needs to be kept busy. Be sure that your Samoyed gets plenty of exercise, as it helps it stay healthy and happy and it helps relieve some of the pent up energy. The more energy it uses up, the less of the impact of separation anxiety and destructive habits. The Samoyed is quite strong, as it used to pull sleds and hunt polar bears, so be careful when playing with this breed.</p>

<h5>Guide to Siberian Huskies</h5>

<h6>Diet</h6>
<p>Fats and protein are the most important sources of energy to a Siberian Husky. Historically, hard-working Siberian Huskies in their original environment ate a lot of fish and other meats, such as locally available mink and otter. These dogs are used to surviving as pure carnivores. Naturally, this diet would be hard to replicate in most domestic environments. These dogs do well on rich and diverse diets that include lean meat, healthy fats, and fiber from dog-safe veggies. However, if you plan on going this route, it’s crucial to consult with a veterinary specialist to make sure that you’re not missing some essential nutrients and putting your dog’s health at risk.</p>

<h6>Training</h6>
<p>The Husky is an intuitive dog and will learn well in an obedience classes, as this environment is set up for learning. When taking the lessons home, your dog may not obey you. Therefore, it’s important to start obedience training as a puppy and establish consistent boundaries at home. If you allow an exception just once, the Siberian Husky will take advantage of it and continue to push the issue. Patience and persistence will be your friend during training. Training will certainly be a challenge with this breed, but it cant be overcome with a loving, yet firm hand. When it comes to socialization, the Siberian Husky integrates well with other animals and humans. Try to keep your Siberian Husky busy with activities to keep it happy. If your Husky gets bored, the pup might find ways to stimulate himself that you won’t appreciate. These dogs need plenty of attention, so bringing another furry companion into your home might go a long way to ensuring a healthy socialization process. Siberian Huskies thrive as part of a pack.</p>

<h6>Temperament</h6>
<p>Siberian Husky is generally a happy dog that will become easily attached to its family. Energetic, fun and playful, the Husky is sociable and can even be quite laid back under the right circumstances. The Siberian Husky has a mind of its own despite being smart. They can get up to trouble if they are given enough attention, so make sure to keep an eye on your Husky. Since the Siberian Husky is active, it will need a home with a large yard. If you don’t have a yard, you must get your Husky out for vigorous exercise every day. Without enough exercise to burn off their surplus of energy, huskies can become destructive as a way to avoid boredom. Because the Siberian Husky can be laid back, it makes this breed a poor choice for a watchdog. You won’t really hear the Siberian Husky bark. Instead, it chooses to communicate via a sound similar to that of a wolf, sort of like a howling noise.</p>

<h6>Common Health Problems</h6>
<p>The Siberian Husky breed is generally a healthy one. There are still a few concerns to watch out for, including hip dysplasia, cataracts and corneal dystrophy.  The Siberian Husky also suffers from a skin condition called dermatitis, which is easily treated with zinc. Occasional bronchitis, asthma and gastric issues can also be a problem. It’s important to maintain regular check ups with a veterinarian (especially as your husky ages) so that any potential health issues can be spotted and treated early.</p>

<h6>Life Expectancy</h6>
<p>Siberian Huskies have a life expectancy of 11 to 13 years.</p>

<h5>Guide to American Shorthairs</h5>

<h6>Temperament</h6>
<p>The American Shorthair is an easy-going cat that openly displays affection and does well with children and dogs. They do, however, like their quiet time and may disappear throughout the day to get it. They are fairly independent, and since they do not typically suffer from separation anxiety, they can be left alone while their humans are off at work. They will play when asked to do so, but they are also great nappers. These quiet cats rarely use their voices. The descriptive most commonly used for the breed is “easy,” which explains their high level of popularity as companions.</p>

<h6>Physical Traits</h6>
<p>The American Shorthair is a robust, long-lived cat, easily reaching age 15 and greater. They have sturdy good looks derived from their “working” heritage. The American Shorthair’s genetics have equipped the breed to be premier mousers and pursuers of small vermin, which accounts for their solid, athletic build. With well-developed chests, shoulders and hindquarters, they excel at jumping and pouncing, and are quite fast over short distances. Males are larger, attaining a weight of as much as 15 lbs while females seldom weigh more than 12 lbs.</p>

<h6>Grooming</h6>
<p>Most American Shorthairs have a dense, short coat that does not require any special grooming. Shedding is generally moderate, and since the amiable Shorthair will readily consent to a nice brushing, that little amount of attention will keep stray hairs out of the house, and give the cat’s coat a lovely, healthy sheen. If an American Shorthair becomes unduly dirty due to circumstances beyond its control, the cat will usually submit to a bath, but normally these cats can be left to their own devices in matters of grooming. Matting is rarely if ever a problem with this breed.</p>

<h5>Guide to British Shorthairs</h5>

<h6>Temperament</h6>
<p>The British Shorthair is an adaptable and calm breed. They learn quickly, and get along well with all members of the household, although they do tend to bond more deeply with the human of their choice. They don’t like to be carried, but other than that the British Shorthair is an easy going cat that doesn’t have much to say. Somewhat rowdy as kittens, they grow out of their boisterous phase to become excellent companions and members of the family. The British Shorthair is not especially vocal, nor are they bad to wander away. They can be left alone without suffering from either separation anxiety or loneliness.</p>

<h6>Physical Traits</h6>
<p>Often described as having a “teddy bear” appearance, the British Shorthair is a sturdy cat with a large head and big, round, inquisitive eyes. The breed is slow to mature, not reaching full size until at least three years of age. They are big cats, with males reaching as much as 17 pounds. Powerful and well balanced, the Shorthair is broad of chest and short of leg with rounded paws and a tail that narrows to a rounded tip from a thick base. Small ears top a sizeable head made to appear even wider thanks to the cat’s full cheeks.</p>

<h6>Grooming</h6>
<p>The coat of the British Shorthair can be compared to a carpet with a deep pile. They have more hairs per square inch in their coats than any other breed. Surprisingly, this luxurious coat requires very little care beyond brushing or combing with a wire toothed comb to remove dead and loose hairs. This should be done on a weekly basis to minimize shedding.</p>

<h5>Guide to Maine Coons</h5>

<h6>Temperament</h6>
<p>Maine Coons are attentive enough to be almost intrusive at times. They like to a part of anything that’s going on, and don’t take kindly to being on the wrong side of a closed door. They enjoy playing in water, and will even wash their food before they eat. They are trainable in a charming “dog like” way, and are highly intelligent, retaining a kind of kittenish energy throughout their lives. They like interaction, but tend to prefer to be close to their humans rather than “on” them. They rarely use their voices, and when they do, the sound is a distinct chirp or trill, often with an inquisitive or independent tone.</p>

<h6>Physical Traits</h6>
<p>Maine Coons are big cats, with some males weighing as much as 25 lbs. They have muscular, rectangular bodies with broad chests. Slow to mature, individuals do not reach their full size for three to five years. Their thick coats are water resistant, with thicker growth on their ruff, stomach, and britches where they most need protection from cold and wet conditions. Their bushy tails wrap easily around their bodies to provide an additional source of warmth. These cats have large rounded feet with tufts that serve as natural snowshoes. Their eyes are big and round and can be copper, green, or gold in tone.</p>

<h6>Grooming</h6>
<p>The silky coat of the Maine Coon has a tendency to be somewhat oily, but although dense, little grooming is required. These cats are good at self-maintenance, but like the attention of being brushed or combed. Once a week is sufficient to keep the coat in good shape, but you may find that the cat enjoys the interaction enough to make more frequent and shorter grooming periods practical and pleasurable for both parties. As with any long-haired breed, a combination of a bristled brush and a wire comb is good.</p>

<h5>Guide to Persian Cats</h5>

<h6>Temperament</h6>
<p>Persians are the most popular of all cat breeds. They have gentle dispositions to match their sweet faces, and the capacity to blend into almost any household once they have become accustomed to their surroundings. Persians are very much creatures of habit. Quiet cats with soft voices, they will even do well with households full of boisterous children once a routine has been established, but their natural preference is for more serene surroundings. Their stature does not make them especially active cats, but they are “posers.” A Persian cat always seems to know where they look the best, and that’s where they place themselves, almost as if they’re attempting to improve the look of the room. They make for close and loving companions, and respond delightfully to attention, giving their affections openly and sweetly. For these reasons, they make especially lovely pets for older, retired individuals.</p>

<h6>Physical Traits</h6>
<p>Persians have short, stocky legs to support their equally short and broad bodies, which are “cobby.” Their overall chunkiness does not make Persians disposed to either jumping or climbing. The sweetness of expression associated with this breed is due in part to the large, round eyes and the cat’s short, flat nose. While some can look a little “cross” at times, their manner is so mild that misperception disappears rapidly. The Persian cat has a large, round head, and small ears that tilt slightly forward. They are regal cats, given to posing and to draping themselves over furniture. While not the largest of the cat breeds, the volume of their fur makes them appear much larger than they actually are.</p>

<h6>Grooming</h6>
<p>A Persian is a strictly indoor cat. They have beautiful long, flowing coats that must be maintained on a daily basis using both metal combs and brushes. It’s a constant challenge to remove dead hair, and to stay ahead of mats and tangles. Fortunately they require only the rare bath. Extra care does have to be taken to keep their eyes clean. The breed can be susceptible to clogged tear ducts if the eyes are not well maintained.</p>

****

<h5>Guide to Ragdolls</h5>

<h6>Temperament</h6>
<p>Ragdolls are happy, docile cats that tend to go limp when picked up. They are not, as some myths have it, resistant to pain, but they are one of the most relaxed of all cat breeds. Because of their extremely trusting and non-combative nature, Ragdolls don’t always discern what’s safe or good for them. They must be strictly indoor cats for their own protection. Obviously they are gentle, affectionate, and intelligent cats, if not possessed with particularly good judgement. They are, however, very lovable, and incredibly easy to handle.</p>

<h6>Physical Traits</h6>
<p>Ragdolls are one of the biggest of all domestic cats. They are sturdy, with large frames and well proportioned legs. In addition to the distinctive point coloration, they always have blue eyes. For show cats, the more intense the eye color the better. Interestingly, they shed less than might be suspected because they do not have a thick undercoat. Most of their long hair is encompassed by long, outer guard hairs.</p>

<h6>Grooming</h6>
<p>The soft, “rabbit like” fur of the Ragdoll is surprisingly insusceptible to matting. Shedding and the corollary problem of hairballs are easily mitigated by regular combing and brushing, which the Ragdolls love. This is even more important during the spring, when shedding naturally increases as the cats lose their winter coats. Wide-toothed steel combs work well and should be used daily. Depending on the amount of loose, dead hair present, bathing may also be required monthly.  Some Ragdolls also experience eye “goop,” which should be cleaned gently away to avoid staining in the corner of the eyes.</p>

<h5>Guide to Siamese Cats</h5>

<h6>Temperament</h6>
<p>Highly intelligent and curious, there are few cats who exhibit the degree of loving devotion seen in the Siamese, but be warned. These cats have a tendency to bond deeply to one person for life. Once that bonding is complete, the Siamese is there to advise you — vocally — on every aspect of your life. (Unfortunately, they can also take a dislike to some member of the family or to one of your acquaintances and be quite obvious in their disdain.) Siamese are legendary for their voices, that caterwaul across the range from gentle chirps to outright shrieks. If a Siamese has something to say, he will be heard. These are highly social cats that do not like to be left alone, a fact they will share with the neighbors at the top of their lungs if you “abandon” them for too many hours at a stretch. The Siamese is also a very high energy cat who is on the go from the start of his busy day until he decides it’s quitting time. At that point he will happily settle in bed, but he’s just as likely to serve as an insistent alarm clock for his humans equipped with an agenda in mind.</p>

<h6>Physical Traits</h6>
<p>The Siamese is a sleek lined, small to medium sized cat with aristocratic and well-defined features. Their almond-shaped eyes are a deep blue, and beautifully contrasting colors mark the “points” of their silky, short coats. Their heads are wedge-shaped and long, topping tubular, muscular bodies supported by fine, graceful legs. Both the tail and neck are elegant, creating the breed’s overall pleasingly linear profile. The profile is totally straight, and the chin especially well aligned. Large, thin ears complete the wedge shape of the head. Once known for both kinked tails and crossed eyes, those traits were seen as a fault, and have been largely eliminated through careful selective breeding.</p>

<h6>Grooming</h6>
<p>The tight, glossy coat is short and fine, adhering close to the body and requiring little special care. Many owners find that nothing more is required than a good rub down with a chamois cloth to remove loose hairs from the coat, a process the convivial Siamese enjoys enormously.</p>

<h5>Guide to African Greys</h5>

<h6>Behavior</h6>
<p>The personality of these parrots is predominantly docile and gentle. Like many other parrots, the African Grey depends on social stimulation and interaction with humans and other birds. Because of their impressive intelligence, though, these parrots might need it even more than your ordinary pet bird! If neglected, your pet can become bored, mischievous, and unhappy. This can subsequently lead to the development of health issues. You’ll have to keep in mind that their remarkable intelligence requires an outlet. Provide this outlet alongside plenty of care, and it will ensure you have a healthy and happy pet parrot.</p>

<h6>Physical Traits</h6>
<p>African Grey are medium-sized parrots, and their length reaches around 13 inches on average. They do boast a broad wingspan of up to 20 inches, so make certain they have a lot of room to stretch out! Although not too large in length, they are still pretty robust and can weigh up to 1 lbs on average. These parrots can have an amazing lifespan of around 50 to 60, even 70 years as a cared for and healthy pet bird. This longevity makes them an excellent choice for a companion parrot, and they often share a deep bond and a significant portion of their lives with their owners.</p>

<h6>Care</h6>
<p>The African Grey Congo diet is varied and needs to be nutritious and filled with necessary vitamins and minerals. The standard seed mix for large parrots will provide a stable base source of nutrients but should be combined with regular additions of fresh fruits and vegetables, like apples, oranges, bananas and plums, as well as cucumbers, corn, carrots, zucchini, and tomatoes. They will love a bit of fresh greens, holding it in their foot as they munch and crunch with a healthy appetite. Offer your pet African Grey an occasional bath and regularly changed fresh water. Provide them with plenty of space and toys so they won’t grow bored and unhappy. You can also let them out of the cage once in a while, but make sure all the doors and windows are closed beforehand.</p>

<h6>Health and Common Conditions</h6>
<p>As a robust and exotic parrot, the African Grey will need looking after. In optimal conditions with sufficient care, problems shouldn’t occur, but with their great lifespan, issues are bound to happen. Be on the lookout for the classic signs that something is out of the ordinary: ruffled feathers, loss of appetite and general apathy, difficult breathing or sagging wings. Another common issue that can occur is feather picking. This is a direct result of insufficient attention, loneliness, and overall poor interaction.</p>

<h5>Guide to Amazon Parrots</h5>

<h6>Behavior</h6>
<p>Amazon Parrots can be considered as one of the friendliest pet parrots around. With their intelligence, talking and down-to-earth friendly behavior, you can only expect to enjoy their company. A development of a strong bond with their favorite person is guaranteed, and this bond can result in some serious jealousy. Things might get heated during the mating season, though, when males could get a bit nippy and bite from time to time. Still, this is not a big deal and passes with time. In summary, if you’re on the lookout for an energetic and goofy parrot, but an affectionate and cuddly one as well, you can’t go wrong with a Amazon Parrots.</p>

<h6>Physical Traits</h6>
<p>Amazons are medium-sized birds, with small differences between the breeds. Yellow Naped Amazon parrots are almost the same as most of their close cousins and is often confused with related breeds like the Yellow Crowned or the Panama Amazon. The adults reach an average length of 14 inches (35 centimeters) and should weigh around a pound (450 grams). These are quite robust birds and should be given plenty of room in order to prevent obesity and problems that occur with lack of exercise. Thanks to their great intelligence, the Yellow Naped parrots are prone to boredom, so avoid keeping them in the cage for very long periods of time.</p>

<h6>Care</h6>
<p>Amazons in the wild thrive on a special diet of fruits, insects, seeds, pollen and more than often agricultural crops. In some areas of South America, they are considered as pests due to their big appetite for common crops.  As a pet, they should be given a balanced diet which is best created with a commercial seed mix designed for Amazons. The second half of this diet is made of fresh fruits and vegetables. These treats are a great source of vitamins. One thing to keep in mind is the importance of showers. Amazons simply love to bathe or shower and you should certainly let them enjoy it. It’s a great preventive against skin diseases.</p>

<h6>Health and Common Conditions</h6>
<p>One of the long-lived species, the Amazons are robust and loved for their good health. You can expect a lifetime friendship that can last up to 60 years. Of course, this lifespan can only be achieved with good care and dedicated attention. One of the main threats for Amazons is their tendency to become obese. Obesity can result in serious problems, so make sure to keep a balanced diet and avoid foods with a lot of fat. Regular check-ups and plenty of vitamins can keep you one step ahead and ensure a happy and healthy pet.</p>

<h5>Guide to Budgies</h5>

<h6>Behavior</h6>
<p>Budgies are highly social birds. Their well-being depends on having company – whether it is yours or of a mate. They also require a roomy cage and plenty of natural light, as well as a chance to fly about freely, at least once in a while. Don’t hesitate to open the cage up and let them fly around the room for a bit, perhaps while you take care of the hygiene of their cage – another important aspect to remember. Of course, it goes without saying that during your Budgie's time outside, all windows and doors should be closed and no other pets should be present in the room.</p>

<h6>Physical Traits</h6>
<p>All Budgies are known for their unique and wildly colorful appearance and amiable personalities. They usually grow around 7-8 inches (~18 cm) in overall length and can live to be up to 10 years old in ideal conditions. The weight of these petite birds doesn’t exceed more than 40 grams! But don’t let their size fool you: Budgies are well known for their ability to persevere and thrive in many global climates.</p>

<h6>Care</h6>

<h5>Guide to Cockatiels</h5>

<h6>Behavior</h6>
<p>Cockatiels are friendly and social, playful birds. A wide and spacious cage will do them good, as they require plenty of exercise and room to play. Perches and parrot toys will help keep this smart bird entertained, but it’s best to get a pair of Cockatiels to keep each other company while you’re at work.

With proper care, healthy diet and exercise, these birds can reach a lifespan of up to 25 years.</p>

<h6>Care</h6>

<h5>Guide to Finches</h5>

<h6>Behavior</h6>
<p>Lively and social, inquisitive and fun, these finches are an entertaining bunch. Avoid keeping a solitary bird, and instead opt for a pair or two, since they largely depend on social interaction with other members of their species. This will require a big cage with a lot of room, or perhaps a modified aviary. During most of the day, they will be active – moving and jumping about as they chirp their beeps and tweets. With their goofy behavior and wild, colorful looks they are sure to take away the dullness and bring about some fun to your day!</p>

<h6>Physical Traits</h6>
<p>Zebra Finches, like most of their cousins, are small birds, reaching an overall length of 4 inches (10 centimeters). Both male and female birds are similar in appearance, with the females being slightly less colorful. Their lifespan is relatively moderate, and in a good home they can live up to 10 years.</p>

<h6>Care</h6>
<p>The usual commercial seed mixes for Zebra finches will be the best choice for the basics of their diet. They contain all the important grass seeds and added nutrients. As an addition to this, you can give your finches an occasional vitamin supplement in the form of sliced oranges, lettuce, spinach or bread dipped in milk. They are sure to love the added goodies. Grit and cuttlebone are also recommended, providing your birds with needed calcium and minerals. Finches love to bathe. So be sure to always provide them with a fresh source of water and a little dish in which they can bathe on a regular basis.</p>

<h6>Health and Common Conditions</h6>
<p>Clean space and plenty of room are mandatory for Zebra Finches. They are nimble and require a lot of space to move around. As a favorite and established pet bird, they are usually very hardy and enduring. Make sure the room temperature is moderate, no draft is present, and hygiene is taken care off – and you’re guaranteed to have little to no trouble. Observe the potential signs of illness, like apathy, prolonged silence, ruffled or missing feathers, etc… Zebra Finches are social so boredom and solitude will do them no good.</p>

<h5>Guide to Dutch Rabbits</h5>

<h6>Behavior</h6>
<p>These rabbits love to be out of their enclosure into the world. Thanks to their gentle nature, they do well with children so long as they are handled carefully and have enough time out of their enclosure to become social animals. Should they spend too much time in their enclosure, they will become depressed and/or bored, especially if they have no companion rabbit with them. They are wonderful first-time pets, as they are relatively low maintenance so long as you provide them with essential items to keep them safe, healthy and happy. Because they are such sociable animals, they are also good pets for couples and seniors, so long as retirees are able to physically to tend to the rabbit’s needs which includes feeding them, cleaning their enclosure and etc.</p>

<h6>Physical Traits</h6>
<p>A show-worthy Dutch rabbit should have a very rounded body throughout.  They have a small, compact body with a rounded head, short, broad ears (especially near the base), and back legs that are longer than the front legs.</p>

<h6>Care</h6>
<p>Like most rabbits, they will live a long, healthy life so long as they are given plenty of outdoor time and fed a diet of 70 percent hay and the rest being a mix of pellets, fruits and vegetables. However, some fruits and vegetables can pose a danger to their health. Unless you’ve researched the fruit/vegetable and are sure it is safe to feed it to them, the rule of thumb is simply not to feed them if you are unsure. Some food that can be dangerous to your rabbit include seeds from fruits such as apples and pears – they contain tiny particles of cyanide and despite being harmless to humans, they can hurt your rabbit. Bark and cherry tree twigs should be avoided, as well rhubarb (it contains oxalates which prevents absorption of calcium) and mushrooms (this hurts them in the long run, as it has been shown to cause cancer in mice).</p>

<h6>Health</h6>
<p>Unlike most animals, rabbit teeth never stop growing. Thankfully, they are also constantly being worn down by everyday activities such as chewing their food and grinding their own teeth. If for some reason your rabbit’s teeth are not being worn down, their overgrown teeth may start growing into their jaw and face, causing severe pain and discomfort. Signs of overgrown teeth or an infection due to overgrown teeth include loss of appetite slugging activity or drooling around the mouth. Be sure to check your rabbit’s mouth often for signs of overgrown teeth and bring them to the vet if you suspect they have an infection, as it can be treated with antibiotics and veterinarians can also fix their overgrown teeth problem.</p>

<h5>Guide to Dwarf Hotots</h5>

<h6>Behavior</h6>
<p>As a rule, this rabbit breed is generally friendly as long as it gets as much human interaction as possible. This means taking your rabbit out of their enclosure on a daily basis and starting the routine when they are bunnies. That way, they will be accustomed to being handled by adults, as well as older children who understand how to handle fragile pets. Dwarf Hotots become quickly attached to their human companions. In fact, owners should take care when opening their cages after leaving them alone for a few hours, as the Dwarf Hotot is known to jump out of its cage in excitement! <br> This rabbit isn’t as active as other breeds, however they can run a few laps around your bunny-safe room before they tire out on your lap. Like most rabbits, they do benefit from having a few bunny-safe toys so they can have some fun while out of their enclosures. Rabbits are a little harder to litter train than cats and dogs, but it is possible. They tend to “go” in one particular corner of their enclosure, so they associate whatever material is used in that corner as the ideal place to do the deed. Therefore, you should place a few of these litter boxes with the same material in different corners of your home. When they successfully do their business in the correct place, make sure to reward them with a small piece of fruit or rabbit-safe vegetable.</p>

<h6>Physical Traits</h6>
<p>As their name suggests, the Dwarf Hotot is a small rabbit that weighs between 2.5 to 3.5 lbs once fully grown. These unique-looking rabbits are best known for their white coats contrasted by the black eye markings. Dwarf Hotot has a compact body type, with a round, well-filled head and short neck. Their hindquarters should be rounded and in line with the wide shoulders. The ears are short and thick. In addition to their adorable looks, these rabbits also have a friendly personality that makes them a good choice for a pet.</p>

<h6>Care</h6>
<p>Due to this rabbit’s small size, it does not require a large cage – a 24 x 24 or 18 x 24 inch cage is sufficient. Usually, these enclosures are made from steel wire, often coated with powder. However, the cage should not have a wire bottom, as stepping on the wire can lead to a painful condition known as sore hocks. Instead, opt for the solid bottom or place a thick layer of rabbit-safe bedding on the bottom to make it soft and comfortable enough for your pet. Bedding needs to be spot-cleaned every day and completely replaced at the end of every week. It is not recommended that this breed be kept as an outdoor rabbit due to its small size. <br> Naturally, the enclosure you get for your pet shouldn’t be their only habitat. In fact, keeping them in a cage all the time would be cruel. Think of your pet’s enclosure like their own little room where they can sleep and eat (and go potty), but your home should be where they get to spend most of their time. Before you let your Dwarf Hotot out of the cage, though, make sure to bunny-proof the room. Hide all cables, protect furniture and remove potentially toxic plants and foods that could poison your pet. <br> The Dwarf Hotot will eat as much as much food as you give it, and although hay should be given in unlimited quantities, rabbits of this size only require a quarter cup of rabbit pellets per day. Their diet should consist of 70 percent hay, a quarter cup of pellets per day, and the rest should be a balance of rabbit-safe leafy greens, fruits and vegetables.</p>

<h6>Health</h6>
<p>Like most dwarf breeds, the Dwarf Hotot is susceptible to malocclusion, a condition where the front teeth are directly above the lower teeth rather than in front of them. When rabbits have this condition, they may accidentally pull a tooth on its cage or have difficulties eating. This can be every 6-8 weeks so they can shorten their teeth. In addition, you should have your vet regularly deworm your rabbit and make sure they have rabbit-safe flea prevention treatment. <br> With all bunnies, but especially those of this size, awareness is what makes sure they get to live long and healthy lives. While there are not generally many diseases that target indoor-only, pet bunnies, there are many conditions that could lead to serious problems if not noticed on time. One those is snuffles, an upper respiratory tract infection that commonly affects all rabbit breeds. Runny eyes and nose, head tilting are just some of the symptoms- if you catch them on time, antibiotics treatment could save your bunny.</p>

<h5>Guide to Holland Lop</h5>

<h6>Behavior</h6>
<p>Indoor rabbits should be let out of their cages with access to roam around at least in one particular room, if not your entire home. This will allow them to stretch out their legs, get some sunshine, and most of all, interact with their favorite humans. <br> The Holland Lop is a relatively active bunny and would also love to spend some time outdoors when the temperatures are just right. Fenced yards are wonderful, but if you have an open yard, investing in an exercise pen should definitely be a priority. Bunnies might seem more manageable than dogs or cats in theory, but when they get excited they will get away from you rather quickly and make a lot of trouble.</p>

<h6>Physical Traits</h6>
<p>While Holland Lop's stocky body and fluffy round head would have been more than enough to make these bunnies cute, it’s their floppy ears that make this breed district and endlessly lovable. Without a doubt, the Holland Lop’s most famous feature is their large fur-covered ears which fall on either side of their heads. The ears are well-furred and thick and they are in the shape of a teaspoon (rounded tips and wider at the bottom). The slack ears that frame their adorable faces only add to the appeal these bunnies have for prospective owners. These rabbits were bred to be as adorable as possible, so you can expect them to worm their way into your heart at first site.</p>

<h6>Care</h6>
<p>As for this rabbit's diet, it should consist of 70 percent high-quality hay and the rest should be a balanced mixture of fruits, vegetables, pellets, and leafy greens. You may find that your rabbit prefers one type of fruit to another (like apples, for instance). While it’s great that your hopper has found a delicious fruit he loves to nibble on, perhaps you can use his love for this fruit as an advantage and use it only during training as a treats. This trick can be used for your animal in order to train them to do simple commands such as heeling or hopping or even for more complex tasks such as litter training.</p>

<h6>Health</h6>
<p>Thankfully, the Holland Lop is not susceptible to any hereditary health issues. Make sure that you regularly check their mouth for overgrown teeth, which can grow into their jaws and mouths and become extremely painful. A diet high in hay will make sure this does not happen, as the hay will naturally file down your rabbit’s ever-growing teeth. <br> Spaying and neutering can be done at a young age in a rabbit’s life. Your bunny does need not be older than six months before they can be safely spayed (some veterinarians will perform the procedure at four months, but most would rather wait until six months). Bucks, on the other hand, can be neutered at as young as three months old and it is commonly known that neutered bucks make for less aggressive companions even though Holland Lops are not that aggressive.</p>

<h5>Guide to Lionhead Rabbits</h5>

<h6>Behavior</h6>
<p>This breed of rabbit is energetic, affectionate and absolutely loves to play. They make wonderful family pets as they love to be picked up, held and petted as often as their human handlers like! They enjoy roaming around their rabbit room, chasing humans around playfully and having plenty of toys they can chew and balls they can play with. Their small sizes make them wonderful apartment dwellers and a great pet for homes so long as they have plenty of time out of their enclosures so they can play and bond with their human family.</p>

<h6>Physical Traits</h6>
<p>The Lionhead rabbit has a wool mane circling around their head much like a lion’s mane, hence their name. They have a high head mount, a compact body which should not exceed 3 1/2 lbs. and ears between 2-3 inches in length.</p>

<h6>Care</h6>
<p>Their diet should consist of mainly hay (70 percent). The rest of their diet should be pellets and rabbit-safe fruits, leafy greens and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables  can also be used as incentives or treats to reward your bunny whenever they complete a task or obey a command (such as sitting, staying, or using their litter box). Adult rabbits can eat about 1/4 cup of high-fiber pellets everyday for every 5 lbs. they weigh, so keep that in mind when feeding your Lionhead, as they are relatively small.</p>

<h6>Health</h6>
<p>Make sure your rabbit diet consists of 70 percent hay (such as timothy) and periodically check their mouths for any overgrown teeth. <br> Also be wary of ear mites that can grow inside your Lionhead rabbit’s ears. Symptoms include scratching more than usual in one or both ears and they make even have some fur loss on the ears. If you suspect your rabbit has ear mites, take them to your local veterinarian to get treated. <br> Most domesticated rabbits also carry the E. cuniculi parasite, which is an abbreviation for Encephalitozoon cuniculi. While this parasite is present, a large percentage of domestic rabbits will not be hurt by it, however if the rabbit is overly stressed, the parasite may become active. Symptoms include a head tilt, paralysis, excessive urination and decreased vision. Consult your local veterinarian to learn more about this parasite or if you suspect your rabbit is suffering from it.</p>

<h5>Guide to Polish Rabbits</h5>

<h6>Behavior</h6>
<p>Most believe that smaller rabbits are best suited for families with young children, as the rabbit is still small, cuddly and adorable well into its adult years. However, the smaller the rabbit, the easier it is for children to drop them and accidentally hurt them, so we do not recommend this rabbit breed for small children despite their affectionate nature. These small rabbits are slightly more trainable than larger ones – magicians, for example, often use these small rabbits as part of their show. While teaching your Polish rabbit how to pop out of an “empty” top hat may not be your top priority, teaching them how to stay, come and litter training them would be useful. Teaching rabbits how to perform tricks and training is not as easy as teaching a dog or cat, but it is possible with time, patience and rewards.</p>

<h6>Physical Traits</h6>
<p>This rabbit breed has a short head with full cheeks, large eyes and short ears which point and touch each other all the way to the tip. They have a compact body shape and carry the dwarf gene, meaning they should not weigh more than 3.5 lbs.</p>

<h6>Care</h6>
<p>These rabbits do not need a large enclosure, as they are small in size. It is recommended to keep them indoors as being outdoors makes them easy targets for predators such as racoons and coyotes. Your indoor rabbit enclosure should be made of wire, be large enough for your rabbit to comfortably stretch out and have a plastic/metal bottom that’s covered in comfortable bedding (horse bedding works well). The bedding needs to be spot-cleaned every day and completely replaced every week. Limit the amount of fruits that are high in sugar, and make sure to stay clear of iceberg lettuce, as it contains too much water and too little fiber to count as a good meal. Do not feed your rabbit yard clippings as grass can be treated with fertilizer, insecticides, pesticides, and other chemicals that can harm your rabbit.</p>

<h6>Health</h6>
<p>Check your rabbit’s mouth at least once every other week to make sure their teeth are an appropriate size. A diet high in hay will make sure that their teeth are properly shaven down (hay does this naturally), but if you find your rabbit’s teeth are still growing out of control, a rabbit-safe block of wood they can chew on is sufficient to keep them at a reasonable length. Otherwise, teeth that are growing into your rabbit’s jaw or face need to be taken care of by a veterinarian.</p>

<h5>Guide to Satin Rabbits</h5>

<h6>Behavior</h6>
<p>Be sure to socialize your rabbit as soon as you can, preferably when it is still a young kit. Socializing your pet means taking the time to bring it out of its enclosure, petting it, and introducing it to children and other animals. Satin Rabbits are generally docile, calm pets once socialized, and will have no problem being picked up by an adult or child. Rabbits can be litter-trained with the same style and size box as cats use, but will take longer to understand the basics. Many owners have found success in placing several litter boxes around the home – more chances of success. With plenty of patience, time and reward-based training, your Satin Rabbit should be litter-trained in a few weeks.</p>

<h6>Physical Traits</h6>
<p>Satin rabbits weigh anywhere from 8.5-11 lbs once they are fully grown and have a commercial body type. The Satin Rabbit has a gradual taper from the widest point at the hindquarters and slightly narrower at the shoulders. It has deep shoulders, backs and loins and have full, rounded hindquarters. Satin rabbits also have bright eyes and erect, full ears.</p>

<h6>Care</h6>
<p>The Satin Rabbit needs to be taken out of its enclosure every day for a few hours in order to be properly socialized and create a lasting bond. This means taking it out of its cage when you are home to play, pet, and simply allow it to hop around and explore . You may also want to take your rabbit outside for some sunshine, fresh air, and playtime. <br> Indoor enclosures should be made of wire with a solid bottom and be large enough for your Satin to hop around freely. Outdoor enclosures can be made of wire or wood, it must be protected from the elements (rain,shine, snow, etc.), and be on a raised platform to protect rabbits from any predators. Both indoor and outdoor enclosures need to be lined with bedding that should be spot-cleaned everyday and completely replaced at the end of every week. <br> A well-balanced rabbit diet consists of 70 percent hay with the remaining 30 percent being leafy greens, fruits, and vegetables. There are many different kinds of hay available, however most rabbit owners opt for timothy hay as it has a high percentage of crude protein, calcium and fiber, is more readily available in stores, and is cost effective. Others types of hay to feed your rabbit includes orchard grass, oat hay, meadow hay, and alfalfa. Water should always be readily available for your rabbit to drink, either in a bowl or bottle attached to their enclosure.</p>

<h6>Health</h6>
<p>The Satin rabbit is not susceptible to any particular health problems, but as with any pet, preventative measures must be taken to ensure it is happy and healthy. Indoor rabbits can develop a Vitamin D deficiency, which can cause a host of problems. To ensure your rabbit has enough Vitamin D, either take it outdoors for some fresh air and sunshine, or let it play in an indoor room that has plenty of windows. <br> Be sure to check your rabbit’s ears for any earwax buildup and/or ear mites, and be sure to bring it to the veterinarian if anything seems out of the ordinary. Monitor the inside of its mouth for overgrown teeth, as this can happen when a rabbit does not have a proper hay diet (hay is important not only to its general health, but also because it wears down a rabbit’s teeth, which continuously grow throughout its life). Outdoor Satin rabbits need to be checked for any soiled fur, as this results in flystrike, an deadly condition that can result in death.</p>
